      <h2>Description</h2>
      <div class="desc">
        <p>
          Participants represent different countries in an auction style event
          where they bid on products from around the world. The team with the
          highest net worth at the end of the auction will be declared the
          winner.
          <br />
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Rules of Procedure</h2>
      <div class="rules">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The event begins with the assignment of countries to different
            teams, with each team taking their position according to the
            designated country.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on prior discussions, the OC will release the auction board,
            listing the products from each respective country along with their
            price ranges. No changes to the prices or points will be permitted
            once the event begins.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participating teams will bid on the products following the standard
            auction process to earn points.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each team will be allocated an equal amount in their treasury, which
            they can utilise according to their strategy and interests. Each
            product will have a fixed price, and any team interested in
            purchasing it must spend the corresponding amount from its Treasury.
            If a team attempts to bid without sufficient funds, it will be
            disqualified from the event.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each product will carry specific points, which will contribute to
            determining the winning team. The final score will be calculated by
            summing the remaining amount in the Treasury and the points earned
            through the auction.
          </li>
          <li>
            The entire event will be monitored by the jury, led by the auction
            coordinator.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

          <li>
            If a team attempts to bid without sufficient funds, it will be
