        <p>
          Bidding War is a strategic team game that challenges your business acumen. 
          Participants will use negotiation skills, strategic thinking, and teamwork to
          acquire valuable properties through competitive bidding. The game consists of 
          multiple bidding rounds, where teams must assess the value of properties and

      <h2>Rules of Procedure</h2>
      <div class="rules">
        <ul>
          <li>
            The event begins with the assignment of countries to different teams, 
            with each team taking their position according to the designated country.
.
          </li>
          <li>
            Based on prior discussions, the OC will release the auction board, listing the products 
            from each respective country along with their price ranges. No changes to the prices or 
            points will be permitted once the event begins.

          </li>
          <li>
            Participating teams will bid on the products following the standard auction
            process set by the organizing committee prior to the event.

          </li>
          <li>
           Each team will be allocated an equal amount in their treasury,
            which they can utilize according to their strategy and interests. Each
            product will have a fixed price, and any team interested in purchasing it
            must spend the corresponding amount from its Treasury. If a team attempts to
            bid without sufficient funds, it will be disqualified from the event.

          </li>
          <li>
            Each product will carry specific points, which will contribute to determining the winning team.
            The final score will be calculated by summing the remaining amount in the Treasury and the points 
            earned through the auction.

          </li>
          <li>
            The entire event will be monitored by the jury, led by the auction coordinator.
