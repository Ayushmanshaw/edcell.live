        <p>
       The Build-a-Thon is an intense 12-hour overnight event where participants are given a domain out of which they will select a real-world problem statement and are tasked with developing innovative solutions. Using tools like the Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, and prototype creation (if necessary), teams will work to design and refine their ideas. The event culminates in a pitching round, where teams present their solutions using a provided template.
This fast-paced simulation immerses students in an entrepreneurial experience, challenging them to think critically and act quickly to solve real-life problems, all within a competitive and high-energy environment.
